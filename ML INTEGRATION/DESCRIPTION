# Description:
This repository contains a hybrid sentiment analysis model that combines traditional machine learning (Logistic Regression) and deep learning (DistilBERT Transformer model) to classify user reviews into three sentiment categories:
Negative (0)
Neutral (1)
Positive (2)
The model is trained on the Yelp Review Full dataset and is designed to provide accurate sentiment classification using both TF-IDF-based Logistic Regression and a fine-tuned Transformer model.

# Key Features:
✅ Dataset Preparation:
1.Uses Yelp Review Full dataset from Hugging Face.
2.Balances the dataset by sampling an equal number of negative, neutral, and positive reviews.
3.Applies text cleaning & stopword removal to enhance data quality.

✅ Traditional Machine Learning Model (Logistic Regression):
1.Uses TF-IDF vectorization (unigrams & bigrams) to extract features.
2.Implements a Logistic Regression classifier with balanced class weights.
3.Evaluates model performance using classification reports & F1 scores.

✅ Deep Learning Model (DistilBERT Transformer):
1.Uses DistilBERT (distilbert-base-uncased) from Hugging Face.
2.Fine-tunes the model on labeled Yelp reviews.
3.Uses Hugging Face Trainer API for training and evaluation.

✅ Hybrid Sentiment Analyzer:
1.Combines both models for robust sentiment classification.
2.Outputs predictions from both Logistic Regression and Transformer models.
3.Provides confidence scores for Transformer-based predictions.

# INSTALLATION AND USAGE:
1. CLONE THE REPOSITORY:
